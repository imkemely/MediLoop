# MediLoop

**Intelligent Healthcare Coordination Platform**

MediLoop streamlines healthcare workflows through automated agent coordination, transforming fragmented patient experiences into seamless care journeys.

## Problem

Healthcare coordination is broken. Patients spend hours navigating separate systems for triage, appointments, and insurance, turning patients into project managers for their own care.

## Solution

MediLoop automates the entire healthcare workflow with intelligent agents that:
- **Triage Agent**: Analyzes symptoms and determines urgency
- **Scheduler Agent**: Finds appropriate care providers and available appointments  
- **Coverage Agent**: Verifies insurance and estimates costs
- **Coordination Engine**: Orchestrates agents to create unified care plans
